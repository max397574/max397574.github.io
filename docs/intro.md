# max397574
I'm a student and interested in computer science.
In my spare time I like working on open source programming projects and learn more things about computer science.

# Projects
## [Omega-nvim](omega_nvim)
Omega is the name of my [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) configuration.
With the recent rewrite it's also possible for other people to use and extend it.
